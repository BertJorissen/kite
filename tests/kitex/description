The tests are separated into three categories:
 - quick KITEx tests: detailed comparison of a very small number of Chebyshev moments
 - quick KITE-tools tests: uses predetermined configuration file to test KITE-tools functionality
 - long tests: combines KITEx and KITE-tools to check if certain quantities are being well calculated
