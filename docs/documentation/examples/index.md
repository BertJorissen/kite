This set of examples is designed to be illustrative but not exhaustive. The aim is to demonstrate how KITE can be used to calculate electronic properties of well-studied 2D materials to allow easy comparison with recent literature. There is also a broad range of examples in KITE's repository folder that illustrate KITE's functionalities across a wide range of tight-binding systems from simple square lattices to 3D lattice models displaying Weyl semi-metallic phases.
